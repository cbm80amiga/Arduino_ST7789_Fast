# Arduino_ST7789_Fast

### This library is obsolete. Use newer version available here: ###

Fast SPI library for the ST7789 240x240 IPS display

Significantly optimized for 16MHz **AVR Arduino boards** (2.5-5x faster than other libraries).

Achieved 6.9Mbps SPI transfer rate (at DIV2/16MHz clock)

In compatiliblity mode it **could** work with other MCUs, but I didn't test it. For STM32 (BluePill) there is separate optimized version here: https://github.com/cbm80amiga/Arduino_ST7789_STM

## Recent optimizations

After recent optimizations (more AVR assembler) all fill and copy operations work with max speed of about 7.1Mbps for 16MHz Arduino and the library flash memory usage is reduced by about 800-900 bytes

## Configuration

Use "define COMPATIBILITY_MODE" - then the library should work on all Arduino compatible boards

Remove above for the best performance on 16MHz AVR

Use "#define CS_ALWAYS_LOW" for LCD boards where CS pin is internally connected to the ground, it gives better performance

Tested with **Arduino IDE 1.6.5 and Adafruit_GFX 1.5.6**

## Extra Features
- invertDisplay()
- sleepDisplay()
- enableDisplay()
- idleDisplay() - saves power by limiting colors to 3 bit mode (8 colors)
- resetDisplay() - software reset
- partialDisplay() and setPartArea() - limiting display area for power saving
- setScrollArea() and setScroll() - smooth vertical scrolling
- fast drawImage() from RAM
- fast drawImage() from flash (PROGMEM)
